Team Project
------------

A major element of this course will be your participation in a team project related to the skills and concepts presented in class. Students will form interdisciplinary teams of 3–5 members to address a topic related to photovoltaics technology, economics, marketing, and / or policy. Several companies and organizations in the Boston area have contributed projects for this course that are of direct and consequential importance to their initiatives in PV technology, business, and policy. The scope of these assignments will vary from project to project, and will be described in more detail below. Students will have the option to join one of the preexisting projects or develop their own topic of research, to be approved by the course instructors no later than Lecture 10.

Groups are encouraged to begin work on this project as soon as reasonably feasible, and to meet with the instructors and project advisors regularly during the semester to verify that their work meets the requirements of the assignment. Groups will be required to present informal status reports to class instructors as follows:

*   Project Check In 1: Teams must meet with your class-instructor mentor no later than Lecture 15 for their first class project check-in.
*   Subsequent check-ins will be at Lectures 17, 19, 21, and 22.

### Project Deliverables

*   15 minute presentation to the class + Q&A totaling approximately 30 minutes, in the last two class sessions. Your presentation will be in open discussion format, with questions from the class encouraged. Your presentation may be recorded by video.
*   An abstract of your research results and an electronic copy of the materials presented in class for presentation on the course website.
*   Maximum 4,000 word paper (plus appendices) due in class at Lecture 24. Teams must submit an electronic copy of this report.

### 2013 Project Topics

Perovskites: A Novel PV Material

Perovskites: Manufacturing, Scalability, and Outlook

Review of Technologies and Applications of Solar Desalination Technologies
